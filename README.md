HelloðŸ‘‹ ! I'm Magner Gusse, currently pursuing my Master's in Aerospace Engineering at Universidade de Aveiro.

I'm originally from Maputo, Mozambique, like most, my interest started from looking up and seeing aircrafts in the sky and the curiosity of how they work. 

I have a broad range of interests within the field of aerospace engineering. My areas of focus include aerospace structures, design, simulations, manufacturing, and other related fields.

I'm also passionate about exploring new technologies and innovations as well as their applications in various industries, as well as developing personal skills that are useful for me as a person.
